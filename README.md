# Inspired by video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snHKEpCv0Hk I created a simple function for everyone to check in Desmos
So there are several steps:
1. Go to https://www.desmos.com/calculator
2. In a field paste f\left(x\right)=\left(\sin\left(k+x\right)\cdot\cos\left(x\right),\sin\left(k+x\right)\cdot\sin\left(x\right)\right)
3. Add slider "k". I prefer to choose to play indefinitely in settings.
4. And finally assign a function with some value to a letter. For example, A=f(3), B=f(pi/4) and so on.
5. Enjoy.
